# KMIP-Client
 
The file *kc.py* is the "main" file for this application.  

The *pykmip.conf* file is an example configuration file and contains default locations for its residency within the file

*pcap* files are just Wireshark files collected for debugging.

All other files are supporting files (especially any .crt, .pem, or .key files)
